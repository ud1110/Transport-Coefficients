This repo has codes to find the transport coefficients/Onsager Matrix using the GK-LRT approach and spectral techniques. The supporting files have not been uploaded, so if the codes are to be used, the names of the files used must be modified.
For Conductivity_Spectral and ConductivityClass, the code is a slight modification of the work by KD Fong. Follow this for her code: https://github.com/kdfong/transport-coefficients
